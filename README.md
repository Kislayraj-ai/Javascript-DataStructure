# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains JavaScript based commonly used algorithms and  data structures.



## Algorithms

`1` Searching Algorithms
  *  Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  *   Naive String search
  * Kmps Search Algo

`2` Sorting Algorithms

 *  `a` Bubble Sort
 *  `b` Insertion Sort
 *  `c` Selection Sort
 
 `2.1` Advance Sorting Algorithms

 *  `a` Merge Sort
 *  `b` Quick Sort
 *  `c` Radix Sort


`*` Divide and Conquere algorithm

    This technique can be divided into the following three parts:
    Divide: This involves dividing the problem into some sub problem.
    Conquer: Sub problem by calling recursively until sub problem solved.
    Combine: The Sub problem Solved so that we will get find problem solution. 
  
  * Example
   
    * Quick Sort
    * Merge Sort

## Data Structures

`1` Linked list

   It is an Data structure in which each node contains
   link of its next node
  
   * Singly linked list
   * Doubly linked list
   * Circular linked list

`2`  Stacks and Queues 

    Stack is a linear data structure which
    follows
    a particular
    order in which the 
    operations are performed. 

    whereas

    A Queue is a linear structure which follows 
    a particular order in which the operations 
    are performed. The order is 
    First In First Out (FIFO).
    The difference between stacks and queues 
    is in removing. In a stack we remove the item 
    the most recently added; in a queue, we remove
    the item the least recently added.

`3` Trees 
  
  * Binary Search Tree (Bst)
  * Avl Tree or Height Balancing Tree 

    
`*`  Binary Search Tree is a node-based 
     binary tree data structure which has the 
     following properties:
 
  * The left subtree of a node contains only 
     nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
   * The right subtree of a node contains only 
     nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
   * The left and right subtree each must also be
     a binary search tree.

 `*` AVL tree is a self-balancing 
 Binary Search Tree (BST) where the
  difference between heights of left and 
  right subtrees cannot be more than one 
  for all nodes. 

`4` Binary Heap

  Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following 
  properties.

 `a` It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely 
 filled except possibly the last level 
 and the last level has all keys as left as
  possible). This property of Binary Heap
   makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

`b` A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. 
In a Min Binary Heap, the parent Element is smaller than
that of its left and rightChild Whereas in Max Binary
Heap its Vice Versa

`5` Priority Queue

Priority queue has same method but with 
a major difference. In Priority queue items
are ordered by key value so that item with
the lowest value of key is at front and item
with the highest value of key is at rear
or vice versa. So we're assigned priority to 
item based on its key value. Lower the value,
higher the priority. 
A Priority Queue is Build with with Binary heap


`6` Hash Tables

Hash Table is a data structure which stores 
data in an associative manner. In a hash table,
 data is stored in an array format, where each 
 data value has its own unique index value. 
 Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.


`7` Graph

A graph can be defined as group of vertices 
and edges that are used to connect these vertices.
A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the
vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex
relationship among them instead of having parent 
child relationship.

* Types of Graph

   * Directed

   * UnWeighted

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

  Shortest Path finding Algorithm

  Dijkstra’s Algorithm allows you to calculate the shortest 
  path between one node of your choosing and every other node in a graph.

#### ALgorithm Implementation  
  Here’s how the algorithm is implemented:

* Mark all nodes as unvisited.

* Mark the selected initial node with a current distance of 0 and the rest with infinity.

* Set the initial node as current node.

*  For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their distances by adding the current distance of current node to the weight of the edge connecting neighbor node and current node.

* Compare the newly calculated distance to the current distance assigned to the neighboring node and set is as the new current distance of neighboring node.

* When done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.

* If the destination node has been marked visited then stop. The algorithm has finished.

* Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest distance, set it as the new current node, and go back to step 4.
